# algorithms-journal
This repository documents my journey revisiting data structures and algorithms —  focusing on understanding *why* they work, not just *how* to code them.

Each folder contains:
- ✅ "Clean", documented code
- 📊 Time and space complexity
- 🧠 Notes connecting concepts
- 🔗 Links back to my Notion reflections

Languages: Java (primary), Python (for visualizations)

> “An algorithm is a story told to a computer.”
